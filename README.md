Inspired by Sahil, CEO of Gumroad.

I found a react on rails boiler plate, and worked with Cursor and Claude to make a Tailwind and Ruby on Rails project to simulate Gumroad.

I'm used to working in stacks with separate codebases for the front end and backend, so I really enjoyed the ease of switching between coding languages and frameworks.

It's also super nice to have everything in the same repository.

I look forward to building more with this stack. I'm a big fan so far.
